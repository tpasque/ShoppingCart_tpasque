# ShoppingCart_tpasque

This is a shopping cart application built in Angular.js during my time in the Galvanize Full Stack Program.

The application is a front-end CRUD app.  It uses higher order functions to complete the edit and destroy portions of CRUD.

The data is provided from a custom built JSON and displayed using Angular.

1. Clone the repository on github at https://github.com/tpasque/ShoppingCart_tpasque onto your local machine

2. Launch a free Firebase application and perform a firebase init command in your terminal inside the folder created from step 1.

3.  My application after this step runs on localhost:5000

4.  Run the localhost environment to display the app locally on your machine.
