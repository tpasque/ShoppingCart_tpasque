# ShoppingCart_tpasque

This is a shopping cart application built in Angular.js during my time in the Galvanize Full Stack Program.

The application is a front-end CRUD app.  It uses higher order functions to complete the edit and destroy portions of CRUD.

The data is provided from a custom built JSON and displayed using Angular.
